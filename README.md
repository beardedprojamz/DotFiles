Collection of Config Files
==========================

This is a list of config files for a \*nix system.
My vim setup is a submodule located at [VimConf](https://github.com/beardedprojamz/VimConf "VimConf") and is a collaborative effort.
I also pull in mathom's config [repo](https://github.com/mathom/Matts-Configs "Matts-Configs") (mostly for his tmux setup).
To use any of these files, just use symlinks from this working copy to the corresponding filename in your home directory.

Collection of Config Files
==========================

This is a list of config files for a \*nix system.
My tmux.conf is adapted from [Matts-Configs](https://github.com/mathom/Matts-Configs "Matts-Configs").
To use any of these files, just use symlinks from this working copy to the corresponding filename in your home directory.

VimConf
=======
My vim setup is located at [VimConf](https://github.com/beardedprojamz/VimConf "VimConf") and is a collaborative effort.
